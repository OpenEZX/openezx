The PCAP Asic as present on EZX phones is a multi function device with
voltage regulators, irq expander, touch screen controller and audio
codec. It has two SPI ports, typically one is connected to the application
processor and another to the baseband, this driver provides read/write
functions to its registers and a irq demultiplexer.

This chip is used on a lot of Motorola phones, it was manufactured by TI
as a custom product with the name PTWL93017, later this design evolved
into the ATLAS PMIC from freescale (MC13783).

Since the last submission we moved ADC and regulator code out of the core
driver and switched to generic irq.
