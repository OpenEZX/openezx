Subject: [PATCH] LEDs driver for National Semiconductor LP3944 Funlight Chip

LEDs driver for National Semiconductor LP3944 Funlight Chip
http://www.national.com/pf/LP/LP3944.html

This helper chip can drive up to 8 leds, with two programmable DIM
modes; it could even be used as a gpio expander but this driver assumes
it is used as a led controller.

The DIM modes are used to set _blink_ patterns for leds, the pattern is
specified supplying two parameters:
  - period: from 0s to 1.6s
  - duty cycle: percentage of the period the led is on, from 0 to 100

LP3944 can be found on Motorola A910 smartphone, where it drives the rgb
leds, the camera flash light and the displays backlights.
