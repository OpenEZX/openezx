The PCAP Asic as present on EZX phones is a multi function device with
voltage regulators, irq expander, touch screen controller and audio
codec. It is connected to the processor via SPI, this driver provides
read/write functions to its registers.

Since the last submission we are also using the spi subsystem and
pxa2xx-spi instead of ssp.c directly as before.
